    Detecting scripts can be done in a few different ways - and can be very difficult to detect false positives.
    My idea is to check for the common scripting languages "magic bites" and file extensions - a proper implementation would check for all these scripting languages.
    Also - check for some magic words that most likely won't be in legitimate software.
